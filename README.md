# Tyler's VSCode Setup for JS Development

Hello! Welcome. These are the settings, keybindings, and extensions I use in VSCode. The following instructions tell you where to put the files on your own system. Once they are there, I encourage you to look into how to enable and use the built-in Settings Sync feature. This will enable you to keep your VSCode settings up to date and use them across devices.

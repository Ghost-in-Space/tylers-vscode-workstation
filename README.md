# Tyler's VSCode Setup for JS Development

Hello! Welcome. These are the settings, keybindings, and extensions I use in VSCode. The following instructions tell you where to put the files on your own system. Once they are there, I encourage you to look into how to enable and use the built-in [Settings Sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync) feature. This will enable you to keep your VSCode settings up to date and use them across devices.
